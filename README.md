## Overview
First up, a list of most of the packages starts over [here](https://github.com/orxngc/dots/blob/main/hosts/anacreon/config.nix#L192). I'll give a quick rundown on the important stuff in case you don't want to go through that; I use Hyprland, Firefox, nvim, Hyprlock, ags, rofi, SDDM, and swaync. The file structure is simple... the configuration is in `hosts/hostname/config.nix`, the home-manager stuff in `hosts/hostname/home.nix`, scripts in `/scripts`, certain program configurations (e.g. hyprlock) in `/config`, and `/modules` for different modules. `hosts/hostname/variables.nix` is also something one may want to fool 'round with. All my wallpapers are available [here](https://github.com/orxngc/walls) and [here](https://github.com/orxngc/walls-catppuccin-mocha).

## Installation
Run this command in your terminal and the script will handle the rest. Note that this won't work for non NixOS users.

```sh
nix-shell -p curl # You can skip to the next line if you already have curl installed.
sh <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orxngc/dots/main/install.sh)
```
Note: I strongly advise you to read the code of the script [here](github.com/orxngc/dots/blob/main/install.sh) before running it. Always read and thoroughly check scripts you see online for your own safety..! 

Press `SUPER + ?` to open a list of all keybindings.

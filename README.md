## Overview
First up, a list of most of the packages starts over [here](https://github.com/orxngc/dots/blob/main/hosts/anacreon/config.nix#L192). I'll give a quick rundown on the important stuff in case you don't want to go through that; I use Hyprland, Firefox, nvim, Hyprlock, ags, rofi, SDDM, and swaync. The file structure is simple... the configuration is in hosts/hostname/config.nix, the home-manager stuff in hosts/hostname/home.nix, scripts in /scripts, certain program configurations (e.g. hyprlock) in /config, and /modules for different modules. hosts/hostname/variables.nix is also something one may want to fool 'round with. All my wallpapers are available [here](https://github.com/orxngc/walls) and [here](https://github.com/orxngc/walls-catppuccin-mocha).

## Installation
Run this command in your terminal and the script will handle the rest. Note that this won't work for non NixOS users.

```sh
nix-shell -p curl # You can skip to the next line if you already have curl installed.
sh <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orxngc/dots/main/install.sh) # Worried that I'm putting a virus in your PC? Read the code here to be sure: github.com/orxngc/dots/blob/main/install.sh
```

Press `SUPER + ?` to open a list of all keybindings.

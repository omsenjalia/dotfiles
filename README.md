# orangc's dots
My dotfiles are a slightly modified version of [zaneyos by zaney](https://gitlab.com/Zaney/zaneyos). They are meant for my own personal use, but if you run the install script you can use them as well.

## A few differences/modifications that I've added ontop of zaney's configs
- Keybinds are different. I updated the bindings button on the waybar to reflect these changes.
- Discord now comes with vencord out of the box (vesktop instead of the official client.)
- The waybar is reordered, and I added a custom module that interfaces with playerctl controls.
- I fixed a problem where there wasn't really a way to lock the screen. The exit menu in the waybar had a lock button which didn't work, I fixed this (w/ swaylock.)
- And of course my own personal styling and configs, like for example this uses my [wallpaper repo](https://github.com/orxngc/walls).
